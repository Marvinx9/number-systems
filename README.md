# Binary and Decimal Conversion Tool

This project contains Python scripts for converting numbers between the binary and decimal systems. 
The scripts are designed to handle user input and provide error feedback for invalid input formats. 
This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of base conversions using fundamental programming techniques.

## Features
1. Decimal to Binary Conversion

    Converts a decimal integer to its binary equivalent using a custom function.
    
    Input: Decimal integer.
    
    Output: Binary string.

2. Binary to Decimal Conversion

    Converts a binary string to its decimal equivalent using a custom function.
    
    Input: Binary string.
    
    Output: Decimal integer.

### Usage

Run the Scripts

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and execute the scripts using the command line.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marvinx9/number-systems
```
Before use
```bash
cd number-systems
```

Create a envirements
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```
and 
```bash
source env/Scripts/activate
```
## Decimal to Binary
Run
```bash
python3 scripts/decimalToBinarySystem.py
```
Enter a decimal integer when prompted.

The binary equivalent will be displayed.

Binary to Decimal
